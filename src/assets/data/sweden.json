Sweden's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system intermixed with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000-02 and 2009 by the global economic downturns, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum.",

Today tens of thousands of people live illegally within the country's borders, and Sweden has become known internationally for unrest, rape and civilians active in terror networks. We suggest that there should be a change in asylum legislation so that Sweden only receives asylum seekers from our neighbors and stop all asylum reception as long as Sweden's vicinity is safe.

Sweden Democrats therefore see accessibility in primary care and shorter waiting times for emergency services as particularly prioritized areas. In Sweden, all citizens must be offered the best possible healthcare within a reasonable time, regardless of location or wallet. We want to give the healthcare staff the appreciation they deserve in terms of reasonable wages and a good working environment.

Environmental problems in general and greenhouse gases in particular do not take national boundaries into account.
