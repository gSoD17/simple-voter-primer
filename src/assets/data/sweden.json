  "introduction": "A military power during the 17th century, Sweden has not participated in any war for two centuries. An armed neutrality was preserved in both world wars. Sweden's long-successful economic formula of a capitalist system intermixed with substantial welfare elements was challenged in the 1990s by high unemployment and in 2000-02 and 2009 by the global economic downturns, but fiscal discipline over the past several years has allowed the country to weather economic vagaries. Sweden joined the EU in 1995, but the public rejected the introduction of the euro in a 2003 referendum.",

We can not accept that the elderly die alone, ending their lives socially isolated or that people feel strongly worried about getting old due to lack of care and poorer pension conditions. All people should be able to age with dignity. On the day of struggling, society will come in and provide the help needed for the elderly to continue to live a safe and meaningful life. Older people should be able to stay at home, even if care needs increased. No one should be forced to separate from friends, relatives and pets other than when necessary for, for example, hospital care. Sweden's elderly should not have to face stressed and exhausted staff. We therefore prioritize the issue of the elderly care working conditions through proposals for the elimination of involuntary shared trips. We also want to give staff a greater influence over working hours and ensure sufficient skills through a special ID for the Nursing profession.",

The Swedish Democrats seek an active but clearly defined labor market policy. We assume a pragmatic, cross-political attitude with the aim of safeguarding the nation's overall interests. This means that we do not carry either classic right or left politics. Instead, we are based on a target image based on labor market balance, unemployment in times of unemployment, improved conditions for SMEs, safe workplaces and cost-effective matching. We also see the need to give the country's entrepreneurs the recognition and support they deserve. We want to see Sweden where it pays to work, create jobs and take risks for a better future.",

Police officers and their families are shrouded at home and their cars blasted while police support is unclear. Current and former governments have seriously damaged confidence in the judiciary. Police officers resign themselves as a result of poor working conditions and a growing threats. Fire brigades and ambulances can not enter in immigrant domains without armed escort. Those who live and work in our suburbs may have their shops robbed, closed down or taken over by criminals. The few perpetrators who are actually convicted of gross crimes are released with mild punishment, while their victims barely receive support. As a result of uncontrolled immigration, terrorists with war experience travel freely on streets and squares and exploit our welfare and asylum system. Antisemitism is growing stronger and Jews fly Swedish cities. Sweden Democrats want a Sweden where people can feel safe - no matter what time of day, regardless of location. A country characterized by loyalty, solidarity and trust towards each other and where the public space is not controlled by criminals. A society where victims of crime receive support and resettlement while the perpetrators receive a punishment in proportion to the seriousness of the crime. A modern public home where we meet those who maintain the system with respect - and not with hatred and violence.",
